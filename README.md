# LAZY
 C library for the stuff you don't really want to add.
 
 # About
 
 LAZY is a C and C++ header file for the things you don't want to have to figure out. Probably because no-one knows what a quaternion is and you just want to get on with your project.
 
 LAZY is made for all projects (but mainly emulators) in C/C++.
 
 # Setup
 
 1. Download the LAZY.h file
 2. Add it your C/C++ project
 3. Add `#include "LAZY.h"` at the top of your C file
 4. Done!
 
 You can call some variables and all functions by using `LAZY_`. To access other variables and all types, use `l`. 
 
 Just read the header file :D
 
 
# License

You are allowed to do whatever you want with the file as long as you do not:
- modify it and share it, claiming it is the original
- claim you made, own, licensed or sold any and all versions it
- relicense it

You must credit me. Literally just `//LAZY made by CoffeeBrewer64, thanks!`.
